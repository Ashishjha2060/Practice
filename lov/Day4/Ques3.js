// DOM is the tree like structure created by the browser that is read by JS to make changes or add/remove elements from the HTML page etc.
// For example :
{/* <p>Hello</p>
<script>
  document.queryselecto("p").textContent = "Hi!";
</script> */}

// Here the text "Hello" is changed to "Hi" after running in Real DOM.


// Virtual DOM is the copy of real DOM that lives in memory and not on screen
// Like we can write frequently used script in real DOM and save it in virtual DOM for quick access later.
